## The project

ErgoDuino is a mechanical keyboard project designed by [Abr1bu5](https://github.com/Abr1bus).

I started to think about it during the first Covid's quarantime, when I was losing my time on [r/MechanicalKeyboard](https://reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards)...

## The tools I used (or will use)

* Layout : [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/)
* Plate : [Plate and Case Builder](http://builder.swillkb.com/)
* Schematics and PCB : [KiCAD](https://kicad.org/)
* Keyboard firmware : [QMK](https://qmk.fm/)

## Where I found all my inspiration/knowledge

# Releases

My very first version is on the repo (dev branch), but I don't know if it's working, so if you want to make it, you should check everything !
